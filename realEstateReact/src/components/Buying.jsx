            Homeownership is a dream for many and a livelihood for some,
            providing a steady income stream. There are various reasons why you
            might be considering a home purchase:
          </p>

          <p>
            As a first-time buyer, you may be uncertain about where to begin.
            You want to escape high rental costs and build equity by owning a
            home. The allure of a brand-new property with modern upgrades tempts
            you. Upsizing to a better home in the same or a different location
            is your goal. Investing in a property for your children's future
            college expenses is a priority. Serious investors seek fixer-uppers,
            renovating and flipping them for profit. A 1031 Exchange is on your
            radar. You and a group of friends aim to buy property in
            partnership, renting it out, and selling it for a profit later.
            You're interested in purchasing land for future residential or
            commercial development.
          </p>
